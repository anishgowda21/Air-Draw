# Air Draw

A web application that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures, captured by their webcam. This app uses computer vision for hand tracking, real-time drawing capabilities, and AI-powered analysis of drawings.

You can see a live demo [Here](https://bit.ly/air-draw) but most propbaly it will be choppy as its a free server. For better experiance host it yourself.

## Features

- ‚ú® **Air Drawing**: Draw using only hand gestures (thumb and index finger pinch)
- üé® **Drawing Controls**: Customize line thickness, color, and pinch sensitivity
- üîç **AI Analysis**: Drawings are analyzed by Google's Gemini AI (when an API key is provided)
- üîê **User Accounts**: Register, login, and manage your API key securely
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices with cameras
- üìä **Library**: View and manage your saved drawings

## How It Works

The application uses:

- MediaPipe for hand tracking and gesture recognition
- Flask and Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Google's Gemini AI for drawing analysis
- Modern security practices for user authentication and data protection

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Webcam
- (Optional) Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anishgowda21/Air-Draw.git
   cd hand-drawing-app
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root (optional):

   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_secure_random_key
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5001
   ```

## Usage

1. **Register or Login**: Create an account to save drawings and add your Gemini API key(which will be encrypted and stored only decrypted by your password)
2. **Drawing**:
   - Allow camera access when prompted
   - Pinch your thumb and index finger together to start drawing
   - Move your hand while maintaining the pinch to draw
   - Release the pinch to stop drawing
3. **Controls**:
   - Adjust line thickness and color using the controls panel
   - Use the 'Min Pinch Distance' slider to adjust sensitivity
   - Click 'Save Drawing' to save your creation
4. **View Drawings**:
   - Navigate to the drawings page to see your saved drawings
   - Click on any drawing to view details and AI analysis (if available)

## Important Notes

- **This is a demonstration application** and uses SQLite for data storage
- **SQLite database may be reset**: If you cannot login, simply register again with the same username
- For a production deployment, consider using a more robust database like PostgreSQL
- Use HTTPS in production to ensure secure transfer of data

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Socket.IO, SQLite, MediaPipe
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- **AI**: Google Gemini API for image analysis
- **Security**: Cryptography, PBKDF2, Fernet encryption
